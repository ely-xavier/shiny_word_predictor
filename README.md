The following repo is the capstone project for the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.

People spends an ever increasing amount of time on their computers, especially on their mobile devices. This trend has exacerbated the need for accurate, yet fast predictive word engines to faciliate typing and text editing on these smaller devices.

SwiftKey is one of the principal players in this market. And this Data Science capston project will be done thanks to the collaborative effort between Swiftkey and Johns Hopkins University.
